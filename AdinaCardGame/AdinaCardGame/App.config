    These 2 paths control where your answer and prompt card files are,
    These files each have one entry per line. They ignore any extra blank lines. 
    For the prompt cards (the black cards with blanks), you can have the app fill up entire lines
    automatically with ____'s. To do this, surround the part of the line with @'s, and include a single _.
    For instance:
    @Step 1: _.@ @Step 2: _.@ Step 3: Profit
    Will have 3 lines on the card:
    Step 1: _______.
    Step 2: _______.
    Step 3: Profit
    
    and the app will make sure that the ___'s fill up the line. 
    
    A second example:
    Instead of coal, Santa now gives the bad children @_.@
    Will print:
    Instead of coal, Santa now gives the bad children
    __________.
    
    The first part (Instead of... ) will wrap onto as many lines as needed. The second part will always be on its own line.
    
    Third example:
    TSA guidelines now prohibit @_@ on airplanes.
    
    Will print:
    TSA guidelines now prohibit
    _________
    on airplanes.
    
    The app also ignores any lines that start with //.
